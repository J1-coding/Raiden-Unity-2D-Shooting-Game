* ### Introduction
Remember the nostalgic game Raiden? Take a trip back to your childhood and try out this remake I've crafted!

* ### Features
Score Manager: Keeping track of your high scores has never been easier! The Score Manager in Raiden monitors and updates player scores, manages the high score list, and provides insights into your performance over time. Beat your own high score or challenge your friends for an ultimate gaming session.

* ### Installation
Follow these steps to get Raiden up and running:

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/J1-coding/Raiden-Unity-2D-Shooting-Game.git
```
Open the project in Unity: Launch Unity, then click on Open and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

Build the game: To create your own executable, click on File > Build Settings, select your platform, then click Build.

Enjoy Raiden on your machine!


* ### Gameplay
To master Raiden, use the 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys to navigate your spaceship up, left, down and right, respectively. Use the left mouse click to fire missiles at incoming enemies. For each enemy you defeat, you rack up points. However, if you come in contact with enemies more than 7 times, your game ends - it's game over.
